## What I learned:
[Data Attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Howto/Use_data_attributes) - I wasn't aware that instead of using classes or id's I could instead use data attributes. I used these attributes to separate their use between js and css, which resulted in a much cleaner look. The syntax is quite simple as stated on MDN Web Docs
>  Any attribute on any element whose attribute name starts with data- is a data attribute
